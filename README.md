This is the React, so front-end, code (redevelopment of a much earlier try) for a app that deals with family-trees. The middleware and database logic that accompanies this front-end still needs to be also pushed (initially) to github.

## Configuration

- Create a `.env` file in this folder for local development.
- Set `VITE_API_URL` to the middleware base URL, for example:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Docker

- Development container uses `dockerfile.dev`.
